# Present Ideas for Loved Ones and Friends

A little tool I made to find genuine, thoughtful present ideas for loved ones and friends by uploading your texting/messaging logs.

## Find thoughtful gifts from your real conversations

Upload a chat export and get a shortlist of present ideas inspired by the things you actually talk about together.

## How it works

1. Export a conversation (WhatsApp/iMessage as .txt)
2. Upload the file to the tool
3. The app picks up interests, hobbies, and moments
4. You get a friendly list of present ideas with short reasons

## Why you'll like it

- Ideas feel personal and relevant
- Fast to try and easy to use
- Privacy‑friendly by design

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start.

## Your data stays yours

- Processing is privacy‑minded; sensitive steps happen in the browser where possible
- Only anonymized content may be sent to AI services to generate ideas
- Nothing is stored server‑side beyond what is needed to respond
